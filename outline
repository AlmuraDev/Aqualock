Just so I can clarify

aqualock.lock - If they can lock
aqualock.lock.cost - If they will be charged
aqualock.lock.cost.digits.decimals - ex. aqualock.lock.cost.9.50 would charge $9.50 to the user when they lock. IF THIS IS NOT PRESENT OR NON NUMERICAL VALUES ARE GIVEN it will default to $0.00

The top three perms are applied for use and unlock

aqualock.admin bypasses lock and use as well as YOU WON'T BE CHARGED. Keep this in mind.
