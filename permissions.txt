Just so I can clarify

aqualock.lock - If they can lock
aqualock.lock.cost - If they will be charged
aqualock.lock.cost.digits.decimals - ex. aqualock.lock.cost.9.50 would charge $9.50 to the user when they lock. IF THIS IS NOT PRESENT OR NON NUMERICAL VALUES ARE GIVEN it will default to $0.00

See above for following...

aqualock.unlock
aqualock.unlock.cost
aqualock.unlock.cost.digits.decimals

aqualock.use
aqualock.use.cost
aqualock.use.cost.digits.decimals

aqualock.admin bypasses lock and use as well as YOU WON'T BE CHARGED. Keep this in mind.
